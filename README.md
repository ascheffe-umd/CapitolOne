Interview App

To run the app you must have NodeJS installed on your machine. See here 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ for more info.

To start the app run the following command `node bin/www` from the git repo top level directory. Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. 

I've also compiled and include a static version of the html page here {git repo home dir}/public/index.html. It should work without the need of a node server. 

I think most of the page is pretty straight forward. The check boxes perform the associated filtering. You can click the export JSON links in both data tables to download the backing JSON. Its format as per the instructions in the email. I also added a blue arrow on the left, if you click it the table row will expand and display individual transactions.

Let me know if there are any issues or doesn't work. 

Thanks,
Aaron
